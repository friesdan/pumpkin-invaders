## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES

### Share buttons don't work
→ Check console (F12) for errors
→ Verify functions defined globally
→ Test in Chrome

### Analytics not tracking
→ Check GA4 ID: G-ZJ3S5S70E6
→ View "Realtime" to verify
→ Disable ad blockers when testing

### Daily challenge not showing
→ Check drawDailyChallenge() called in draw()
→ Try localStorage.clear() and refresh

### Screenshot blank
→ Call after draw() completes
→ Use Chrome (best support)

### AdSense not showing
→ Takes 1-3 days after verification
→ Need 50+ daily visitors
→ Auto ads can take 24-48 hours
